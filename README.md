# CDR-Lite

The National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Comprehensive Data Resource (CDR) is a distributed web-based system that manages and maintains multi-dimensional data models on biospecimens. The CDR was developed and is currently utilized to collect biospecimen annotation and clinical data on biospecimens collected from cancer patient donors and post-mortem donors, for the NCI’s Biospecimen Pre-analytical Variables (BPV) and NIH Genotype-tissue Expression (GTEx) programs.

The CDR provides secure data access based on a user’s roles and privileges. Through dynamic content redaction, it protects private information in compliance with HIPAA regulations. Its graphic user interfaces streamline data entry workflow based on SOPs for sample collection and processing. The automated data checks and validations confirm data integrity and SOP adherence simultaneously.
